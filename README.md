# Drone blog website
Website created with React without any backend support. Only JSON server was used for mock-up database to store the blog posts.

## Running the application
To run the react application you need to be in main directory and use command
```npm install``` to install all necessary dependencies and then just run ```npm start``` to start the web app.

## Inspiration
The web app was inspired by _Full Modern React Tutorial_ series ([link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d)).
